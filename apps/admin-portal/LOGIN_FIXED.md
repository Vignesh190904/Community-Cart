# 🔐 Admin Portal Login Issue - FIXED! 

## ✅ **Problem Resolved**

The admin portal login issue has been successfully fixed! The authentication system is now working correctly.

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### **Root Cause**
The issue was caused by authentication middleware conflicts in the backend routing. The admin vendor routes were mounted at `/admin` with authentication middleware, which was interfering with the admin auth routes mounted at `/admin/auth`.

### **Solution Applied**
1. **Separated Route Mounting**: Moved admin auth routes from `/admin/auth` to `/auth/admin` to avoid conflicts
2. **Removed Global Middleware**: Removed authentication middleware from admin auth routes
3. **Updated API Endpoints**: Updated the frontend to use the new auth endpoint path
4. **Restarted Services**: Restarted the backend server to apply all changes

## 🚀 **Current Status**

### **✅ Working Features**
- **Admin Login**: Fully functional with proper authentication
- **Token Management**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Session Management**: Proper session handling
- **API Integration**: All admin endpoints working correctly
